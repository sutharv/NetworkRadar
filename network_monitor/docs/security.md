# Security Features

## Threat Detection

### Network Radar
The NetworkRadar component provides sophisticated threat detection:

1. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Machine learning-based pattern recognition
   - Baseline traffic analysis
   - Deviation detection

2. **Attack Pattern Recognition**
   - DoS/DDoS detection
   - Port scanning detection
   - Brute force attempt detection
   - Data exfiltration monitoring

3. **Organization Tracking**
   - Connection history monitoring
   - Suspicious organization detection
   - Traffic pattern analysis
   - IP address tracking

### Traffic Guard

The TrafficGuard component provides:

1. **Connection Filtering**
   - Bandwidth monitoring
   - Connection rate limiting
   - Suspicious pattern detection

2. **Blacklisting**
   - IP-based blocking
   - Organization-based blocking
   - Country-based restrictions

3. **Port Monitoring**
   - Suspicious port detection
   - Service identification
   - Port scanning prevention

## Alert System

1. **Threat Levels**
   - LOW: Minor suspicious activity
   - MEDIUM: Potential security concern
   - HIGH: Immediate security threat

2. **Alert Types**
   - Security violations
   - Threshold breaches
   - Anomaly detection
   - System performance
   - Connection attempts

## Security Recommendations

The system provides automated security recommendations based on detected threats:
- Connection blocking suggestions
- Rate limiting recommendations
- Port access restrictions
- Traffic pattern adjustments
